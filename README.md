# Problems along the way
There main probelms that occured was some of the images would not load when trying to run the website however with some research this was quickly mended. Also when trying to use float sometimes it would not work but when playing around with it made everything fall into place.

# Reflection 
When looking back at the whole process there are somethings that now i wish i would devlop more, because i lose the ability in myself sometimes it can take a while to get the code and layout right. Also creating the website for a friend took more time than normal as having to talk about the layout and the content of the work. I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the website with some guidence from w3schools. Overall i feel that with more time this website could look alot better. 
  
# Conclustion
Overall this project was something of a challenge however it came together for the end result.
